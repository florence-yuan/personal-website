# A Little Girl

All things fall into disrepair
A misshapen river flows under our feet where
we used to whisper about the day that spread
above us like honeysuckles and lilies

You used to say that play was a long
preamble for more glorious chapters of life
The first cymbals and brass before
Sunrise shatters the world

You and I, we are in that mellow world, too,
I said, and I should like this to last forever
When we are twelve, twenty-two, one hundred,
I hope we still push each other on swings

Swinging to the sun and rain and river of flowers
that bind our bodies to shadows tall, and then,
no sunrise to shatter this world, and then,
no glory I do not desire with my body and my shadow tall

Free fall
I sense its decrepitude, like a worm that has burrowed
Deep into the fabric of that glorious day
its pure blue now tainted and bitten through

The worm. Something snub nosed and ungenerous
lurking in a cave too ancient to illuminate
I call to you, but receive nothing
beyond that distant echo
