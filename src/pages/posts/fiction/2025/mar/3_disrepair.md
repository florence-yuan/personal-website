# In Parallel

Loneliness fits me snugly
Like a wet coat in the rain, a flimsy thing
Heavy with the in-substance of dissolving
And all touch is but the touch of my own skin
Somewhere along the road there strolls a dream
Now and then it pauses, and lifts its head, as if
To inhale this strange atmosphere of rain
Only it is not rain at all, but a soul
As lonely as its own, a wet coat
Turned inside out
To bare skin
Meeting rain
And in between
A conglomeration of being
We meet rain with our skin and nothing else
In this we walk parallel with dreams
