Now that the crisis has passed, the whole thing seems to have unraveled itself until what remains of it is the barest of outlines, like the strings of gauze from an abandoned web that shimmers and fades in plain sight.  There is no help for it now; I cannot chase the thoughts from my mind, and all the thoughts keep going round in circles, the egg to the chicken, the chicken to the egg.  That’s right – eggs.  I can’t seem to recall exactly why I bought the eggs.  Possibly it had something to do with their roundness; the firm, supple, brown things sat fatly in dimpled cartons, exuding an air of comfort and luxury so sorely lacking in the surrounding stench of fish and the sound of the little plastic fans whirling busily overhead.  Possibly it was the old woman who hovered by my elbow, wearing an apron that smelled of clean cotton and strong soaps.  I was too embarrassed to look her full in the face, not more than a fleeting glance to know she was old and weathered with a tangled crop of lean black hair.  But I heard her voice; it was a sonorous chirp that carried over the confused whirl of electric fans, and I understood just enough of it to know she was trying to make me buy the eggs.

I have yet to master the art of refusal.  Now and then I have struggled with it, but lately I have come to understand that it is all a grand act of futility, a few feeble, stuttering violins that struggle to strike up a symphony against the devils that keep steadily in their walk from one end of the earth to the other.  Perhaps this is why, when I exited the market five minutes later, I had the eggs in an ugly plastic bag hooked to my elbow, pulling hard on my arm like a sack of stones.  The balmy breeze of June brushed past my sleeve, rustling the bag and knocking the cartons into each other with a soft, brittle rhythm.  Jesus, I thought with a rush of irritation, they don’t even have a lid.
Not until I arrived at the nursing home did I remember I had forgotten to buy cakes.  My grandmother had been wanting cakes.  The honey-flavored ones, she’d told me, made in the shape of five-petaled flowers and put in large paper bags with the scarlet stamp of her favorite brand.  She was growing old, now, and growing every day a sense of the particular.  The old pedantic melodrama was still within her, but on the surface she had grown harder, more vacant, abstract, closing off at the smallest offense.  With half a mind I calculated the amount of time needed for me to double back to the market (sixteen minutes, I decided); with the other half I calculated how big of an offense the eggs would give.  My wrist ached terribly, however, and with a grim smile I thought, eggs will do.  Yes, they simply must.  But on my way up to my grandmother’s room the doubt began to grow, and when the elevator stopped at several floors and people filed in and out, I hid the bag of eggs behind my back.

My grandmother was lying in a white bed in a white room, its curtains half-drawn against the mellow light of the late morning.  Many of her roommates were dozing.  She looked up when I walked in, and she immediately wanted to know what I was hiding like that.  She looked hassled with her white hair sticking up in an uneven halo, one withered brown hand poised restlessly on the sheet at her chest.

“Eggs?” her voice crackled and sank into a pool of phlegm.  “Eggs?  How’m I supposed to eat those things?”

That was the truth, and I had no answer.  So for a while we stared at each other; or rather, we both stared at the eggs, which after a few seconds protested at the intensity of our gaze, and startled my hand with a sudden rustling of shells and plastic.  I was the first to look up.

“Well…  I was thinking you could have somebody cook them.”

“And who’s going to do that?”

Again I had no answer.  To lighten the mood I said playfully, “How about you have some fun with them instead?  You could paint them, you know, like what I used to do in school, or you could douse them in vinegar and make them into pale rubbery balls that bounce all along the tabletop, and…”  My voice trailed into silence.  My grandmother did not even deign to blink.  Repelled by her frown, appalled by my own absurdity, I wisely decided to end my visit.

“I’ll bring you the cakes next time, Grandma,” I said as I took my leave, discreetly switching the eggs to my other elbow.

“Goodbye, goodbye.”  She looked bored and tired by now, and I was sorry.

In the corridor I bumped into Lily, my grandmother’s nurse.  She smiled, greeted me, and was about to pass, when a mad impulse made me call her back.  “Won’t you take the eggs?” I said, breathlessly, pushing the bag at her with a gesture that felt painfully familiar.  “Take them or give them to the cook, anything…”

She stared at me for a moment, as though uncertain if I was serious.  Then the professional friendliness reasserted itself on her soft features, and she said in her gentle, polite voice while backing away, “Oh no, miss, I would rather not.  Eggs spoil fast, you know, and there are no fridges here…”

Of course there were no fridges.  It used to be an endless bother for my grandmother, whose friends frequently unloaded baskets of fruit onto her bed – bunches of bananas, heaps of apples, and rather exquisite, purplish-green grapes which she always offered to me, wryly, one after the other, until I choked on the sour-sweetness in my own saliva, and had to stop.  “Better eat it now than have it rot,” my grandmother would say sagely, her white head propped up above the various assortment of fruits.

I have always wondered what would happen if the fruit did rot.  Growing up in a frugal family that seldom bought more than it needed, I have never had the privilege to witness decomposition first-hand.  Even with the terrifying amounts of fruit my grandmother received in her first months at the nursing home, sooner or later they were consumed in their entirety.  “Don’t you throw away anything?” I used to ask her, and received in response the most scandalized looks.  I took that as a sign that nothing ever did rot or go to waste, not under my grandmother’s watch.

Sure enough, that very evening I received a call.  My grandmother wanted to know what I’d done with the eggs.

“I thought you didn’t care for them?” I said, as flippantly as I dared.

“Well, you were terribly irresponsible to buy things you knew I couldn’t eat, and you didn’t need, so I thought I would give you some advice…”  And she went on to give me various recipes involving eggs, which quickly expanded into detailed descriptions of times and temperatures and ingredients; a certain need for oil to bubble, another for the egg to brown at the edge, and so on and so on.  The irritation I had felt during the morning swelled within me, a force that always drove at half-pressure, never with full strength, but was as enduring and as relentless as insomnia.  Long after the call had ended, it was the only thing that was still coherent, and sustained me with its coherence.  All the rest of the talk had seeped out into a desert of feeling.  Only irritation remained, and it maddened me into the surprising state of sorrow.  After shedding a few tears I calmed down, and I resolved to be good, after all.

The eggs I labeled with markers.  I considered marking an act of rebellion.  All my life I had enjoyed drawing on things that did not need the drawing.  Eating itself was compulsive, a necessary thing of nature that I often despised.  The act of writing rendered it art.  So I drew numbers and circles onto the eggs, pretending I was eight, eleven, fourteen, when I carelessly spun about from the sofa to the dining table, and covered every inch of pragmatic surface with spiraling shapes.  “Holy moly,” my grandmother used to say, “Clean it off!  Clean it off!”  I did not need to clean anything now, but after all I was being good, even through this small rebellion.  I was dividing the eggs into their various uses – the scrambled, the hard-boiled, the poached…
My grandmother informed me the following morning that she was feeling poorly.  I was also feeling poorly.  I had just consumed a hard-boiled egg that had been badly cooked, partially because I had been scrambling to answer the phone.  “You didn’t throw away the eggs, did you?” my grandmother asked suddenly, with more spirit than she had shown up to this point.

“No!” I shouted.  An egg was now churning uncomfortably in my stomach.  I had swallowed it whole, after all, and just thinking about the soft, white, round thing sliding down my throat made me nauseous.

“Well, come see me today.”

“Can’t,” I murmured, but my grandmother wasn’t listening.

The next day I accidentally dropped an egg.  “Shit,” I mumbled, as I stood surveying the mess on the kitchen floor.  The egg white was rapidly seeping from the shell, looking rather like ectoplasm on the dark varnished tiles.  I stood staring at it for a few seconds, until the yolk had completely settled in its pool of ghostly white.
“Well, here goes,” I said, moving an old rag menacingly toward the small puddle of egg.  I waved it over the shells.  Again, and again, my gestures growing more and more airy.  After several tries I withdrew the rag slowly.  A curious excitement had begun to build in me.  Here was waste, accidental waste.  Perfect, pristine, fresh from a folly of nature.  I could not destroy it.  I must let it unfold and take on its natural course.
My grandmother began to call me twice a day.  She had slipped back into her old habits of chatter, I noticed, the hard abstractness giving way to a new urgency for communication.  She told me at length about her new illness, some irritating trait of one of her roommates, something the nurse could have done better and forgotten, perhaps out of spite…  She was alternately confident and afraid.  On some days she was pleased with her progress and the world was splendid and generous; on other days she moaned about a new cough, a new tremor she perceived in one hand, a certain coldness that belied the warmth of June.

Meanwhile, I tended to The Egg.  I had developed the tendency to see it as singular, a separate entity from the rest of its perfectly round, unbroken mates.  The latter I consumed one a day.  I had forgotten the meanings of the markings, and could not bother with learning, so I ate them all hard-boiled, each a little wobbly, a little soft.  I gagged when I ate them.  I still swallowed them whole.

The Egg, on the other hand, had become a point of fascination, a thing subtly manifested through air and shadow.  It still sat on the floor as I had left it, little blob of yellow protruding from a cosmic pool of colorless jelly.  It sat, it brooded, it mellowed and grew in a patch of sun.  It enthralled me with its odors when, after a particularly warm day that woke up the honeysuckles, it gave out a whiff of sulfur.  And then something happened – something absurd and yet inexorable, prodding on my consciousness like a gentle yet insistent finger.  I lay down with my belly flat on the floor, pressed my nose to the fragments of The Egg, and inhaled.

At first, it was perfectly repulsive.  I have always had a keen sense of smell, and the odor of bathrooms a floor away troubles me as much as a grain of pollen irritates my grandmother’s nose.  The Egg was even worse – it not only smelled, it festered.  A new glossy sheen established itself over the egg white, disturbing its milky way with little dust-like stars.  Then the yolk itself was disturbed.  The glutinous blob fractured into ever so many hardened nodules of dusky yellow, each thrusting up a new scent that I devoured eagerly with my nose.  I fed it a tiny piece of raisin.  The Egg gobbled it up.
“I am tired,” my grandmother told me one day over the phone.  “I am so tired I can barely get out of bed every day.”

“You talk just fine.”

“Ah, the heartless generation!  Very well, you ungrateful child, you shall be sorry when I am truly dead, dead as a doornail and buried where nobody can find me.  Then you will be sorry.”

She asked about the eggs.  I knew she was just trying to make me visit her again.  “I haven’t got any cakes,” I told her, “No cakes!  I eat an egg a day.”

“Good girl,” said my grandmother approvingly.  “Come see me today.”

“Not today,” I mumbled.  Then, with a note of contrition, “How is your pneumonia?”

“Better.”  Then she sighed.  “Come see me tomorrow.”

I paused.  “All right.”

I went to see her with the cakes she wanted.  I was a little shocked to see she was being administered fluids through her veins, several bags of liquids hung high over her bed.
“About time!” said my grandmother irritably as I put the cakes on her bedside.  I immediately wondered if she had planned this spectacle.  My shock, I imagined, would be gratifying to her.  Perhaps she thought it would startle me into greater kindness.
By the time I’d gotten home I could barely stand.  I went to the toilet and vomited up everything I had eaten, which happened to be a single egg during breakfast.  I watched the grayish mush swimming and swirling in the toilet pan, little bits of egg from a single whole.  The nurse had told me my grandmother’s condition was worse.  They might have to move her to the hospital soon.  As I was preparing to go to bed I remembered the cakes.  My grandmother had made me take them back, saying she did not feel like eating.  I supposed I did not feel like eating either, until I remembered The Egg.  I broke off some crumbs from a cake and headed to the kitchen.  Sprawling myself out on the surprisingly cool kitchen floor, I buried my nose in the smell of Egg.  With a lazy hand I fed it the crumbs.  It gurgled happily as it reeled in the cake, sending up a gentle burp.  When I finally fell asleep Egg slid into my pocket, and became flowers and jam, the taste of fruit and sweet cake bursting upon a senile sea.

The next day I went to the hospital where they had moved my grandmother.  There weren’t enough beds, so they put her on a blue stretcher with a hard mattress and a single sheet.  She had a fever and was mumbling a low, unbroken stream of words.  For a moment I was afraid she might not recognize me, but when I bent down she suddenly reached up, and as she patted my face lightly with a wrinkled palm she whispered, “Good girl.”  Something stirred in my memory at these words.  I wondered if she was still thinking about the eggs.  I had refrained from eating them since I had vomited one up, and at this very thought my stomach began to churn.  I felt vaguely sick.  Hastily I straightened up, and let her hand fall.

When midnight was past the doctor suggested I leave.  “We’ll wait and see,” he said, as did the nurses.  “We’ll give you a call if anything changes.”
The apartment was pitch black when I returned, the landing lights flashing for an instant into a rear window like a bolt of summer lightning, silent and abrupt.  I did not bother with the lights, instead heading to the kitchen, where I groped on the floor with my fingers, but everywhere they met with the coolness of the wooden tiles, smooth and heatless.  Slowly, almost afraid to disturb the quiet, I pressed my cheek to the floor and peered sideways at the tiles, at the faint traces of their edges that led to so many paths through the darkness.  Then I felt my breath catch.  Where The Egg used to be was what looked like a purple stain, a blemish, a bruise in the skin of the wood.  As the minutes ticked past it bit slowly into the floor, a cosmic void that stretched its elastic fingers close to the surface of the nebulous night.

And still the night was silent.  I pressed my face closer to the floor, so close I could not breathe, but there in the gaps of breathing I thought I detected a whiff of Egg.
I woke up falling, to the sound of my phone ringing.  The egg broke, then, through my pocket, and vomited up in an unbroken stream all the fruits and cakes and flowers it had consumed through the weeks, ejecting them out from the center of the galaxy to its most distant spiral, an arm of stars that glistened like dust.  So this is it, I thought, the moment of breaking away from all that is true and rational – life, attachments, whatever exists between people – into the distant unknown.  Then I realized the breakage had occurred much earlier.

The phone rang.  I looked down.

Below me was a stain the shape of an egg.

The egg ate me up slowly.
