It is a truth universally acknowledged, that great novels open with great lines -- almost as universally acknowledged as, say, 'a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife'. _A Tale of Two Cities_ opens with the oft-recycled 'it was the best of times, it was the worst of times', and _Anna Karenina_ with that _true_ but unhappy idea that 'happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.' I say unhappy, because it would be invariably dull for families to behave in the same way, even if it is to enjoy perfect happiness. We would all be reduced to perfect specimens of sheep and cows, neither too large nor too small nor too picky in one's diet to be excluded from the happy circle of happy families. Of course, the Anna Karenina principle has already been utilized by eminent scholars as a great model for domesticating animals, and to great effect I'm sure. But I digress. What I mean to say is that Tolstoy is of course, perfectly correct. What depresses me is that great novels in possession of great fame should be so alike.

Namely, in their perfect first lines.

As a struggling writer myself, I have ample reason to complain. Many of my unfortunate novels stalled within the first ten chapters, that is true, but the overwhelming majority wilted far before this -- before, indeed, the first line could be composed with a pen or a bunch of keys on the computer. Many will attribute this to common laziness. I quite agree, but only on the point that I am lazy. I am indeed lazy, as lazy as a pig that has suddenly discovered it can sing but that, alas, its vocal chords aren't quite up to carrying the strain. A little strain is stimulating. Too much is overwhelming. Extend this to my situation, I challenge you. You might say that novel-writing overwhelms me because of my inherent pig-like tendencies. But I dispute this. I dispute this with a fervor, a certain tingling of veins and mind and vocal chord.

Let us suppose, for a moment, that I am a perfectly diligent person - that I wake up at five, eat at one, and write far into the night, the brass clangs and dings of Strauss keeping me awake until five the next morning. Yes, I write. But so what? I play Strauss on repeat, again and again he startles my sleep-hogged brain into the vain anticipation of sunrise; but what do I open my writing with?
Here, I'm afraid, my courage fails me. It withers and wilts just as the illusion of sunrise invariably dissipates into the bleak and dreary night. The sun never rises at the crucial moment. How can I hope to replicate the grandeur of those unforgettable sayings of the great and glorious, the pithiness of Austen, the sweeping grandeur of Dickens, or even the reverse-flashback of _One Hundred Years of Solitude_: 'Many years later...'

Ah yes, if only I, too, could know that many years later, I would be a great novelist, with plenty of fame and fortune and not just a little of literary credit. My eyes well up with tears as I type this on my ramshackle computer in my ramshackle makeshift shed of a home (Dickensian, yes). How did Dickens manage it? How did the man whose books were serialized and read by street sweepers - a sure sign of being 'common', a 'mere popular author' - manage to ascend the eternal throne of literary eminence?
For many a month I have pondered this question. In the end, I was forced to conclude that, yes, Mr. Dickens relied on his greatest weapon, and this greatest weapon only.

His opening line.

Why are some books forgotten and some not? The more shameless of us proclaim that the important thing is the exquisiteness of the cover; people judge by the cover, they say. But I refuse to believe we modern men and women can be so shallow. As a BBC article from a few years ago points out, and correctly: choosing a book by its first line somehow feels more respectable than judging it by its cover. And it is true, perfectly true. Opening lines suit us. All our little ventures and businesses culminate in the very beginning and become intolerable messes by the end, and so it is only right that we judge others by the same criteria.

So how to write the opening line? I have bored you with reasons, anti-reasons, theses, antitheses, and god knows how much nonsense and anti-nonsense. Get to it, now, I hear you mutter. But pray allow this lone defender of procrastination a little more time. You see, there are never good themes, only good styles, as Wilde has reminded us more than once. It is the style of the thing that is all-important. And I have browsed the internet in style. I have found little of consequence in regards to meaning. In regards to style I have found ample information. The first line must be simultaneously succinct, intriguing, delicious, manipulative, alluring, anti-cliche, good cliche... It must draw the reader in and spit them out, it must be straight to the point and coy enough to maintain a veil. In short, all of the above and none of the above. The only thing everybody can agree on, it seems, is that whatever style you use must be good enough for marketing, better indeed, than that exquisite jacket of your book your designer and illustrator labored on for so many months.

So can you really place your illustrator's talents so low as to believe that your first line is anything but well nigh impossible to write? Can you really hold your publishing team's efforts so cheap that you spoil all the careful artistry and mystery and straightforwardness evinced by their collective product with that one line of unutterable horror _you_ wrote - forever a meme, never an icon?
_I_ can not, and _will not_, do so.

I have therefore determined that never again in my life shall I write another ten chapters of worthless drivel without an opening line to crown them all. I shall allow my ideas to sleep in their buds as soundly as blood-red poppies, to ferment in their wine vats buried deep in the French catacombs... And when, at last, they yield that coveted, miraculous, delectable opening line... I shall be finally ready to begin my great work.

Perhaps one day, many years later, you shall hear of my name. I do not particularly care where, provided it is full of gold and silver and far, far away from the blacking liquid the child Dickens once used to affix labels to bottles. Labels never work, just as covers never do. Go ahead. Disregard that curious design of the publishing house (it does not matter unless _you_'re getting published by it); disregard the strange abbreviation my name shall certainly be reduced to by then (think J. K. Rowling); disregard, even, those thanks I dispense to individuals too numerous to be named, far too generously, I own. Disregard all of that. Turn to the first page. Cast your eye to the first line of the printed letters. Block out the rest. No one remembers them.

_One line to rule them all._
