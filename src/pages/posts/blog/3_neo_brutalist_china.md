# Hard Times | A Neo-Brutalist China
Brutalism as a style and a movement, it would seem, belongs to the history books and the occasional film. Even at its height it was far from a global language, and as an art form it has long been criticized as cold, ugly, overpowering - steel and concrete that leapt quickly out of the earth to replace what had been lost in war. It has additionally acquired an unsavory overtone of socialism - low-cost, low-quality equality that could be mass produced to fill the void left by Man's nostalgia. For thirty years it flourished in Europe. After thirty years it was dead and buried, and what remains is seldom liked well enough to trigger a new generation of enthusiasts, even in theoretical appreciation. After all, how many of us would prefer an afternoon staring at a bare block of Socialist-style concrete to an hour spent in any of the Gothic churches in Ille de France?
But if you think Brutalism is truly dead, think again. Language is, after all, interchangeable. Map Brutalism to a different century, a different country, and perhaps you will find it has not disappeared after all.
I am speaking, of course, of 21st century China, where steel and concrete have become the ubiquitous language of its metropolises and smaller cities alike. Pick any city off a map of China, and lo and behold, it is a concrete jungle. It masquerades its ugly forms with the allure of a few temples and 'old-culture towns' that Westerners mistake for originals, but for the plebeians it only provides the most minimalist cement blocks. Of course, the Chinese government could hardly condescend to bestow a Western name upon its favored style of architecture. It has already crafted several well-deserved titles after all, _in Chinese_, such as "the advance of Chinese tech" and "changing day by day, month by month"; old houses are torn down and covered up, new ones spring up quickly from the soil, and the government reaps the profits of the land sales. And indeed, all this happens within the space of a day, a week, a month. How can style be desired now? Surely utility is the most important thing.
Enter Neo-Brutalism.
The command is given. The people are evicted. The bulldozers push through. Steel and concrete leap up from rubble. All of this is performed ruthlessly fast, resulting in ruthless structures that look dizzyingly alike. Rather brutal, yes. But more brutal than you think. So brutal that many structures are left unfinished, 20 million by one estimate. So the big construction companies are left bankrupt, and the plebeians are left dangling by the strings of their purse. The ultimate Neo-Brutalist structure is a monument to Economy.
