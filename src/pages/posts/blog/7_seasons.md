There's a scene in D.H. Lawrence's _Women in Love_ where Ursula and Birkin are onboard a ship to the Austrian Alps, and huddled so close on the deck they have physically almost become one. And yet their mood and vision could not have been more different. Ursula saw the voyage as a path to a new beginning, while Birkin saw it as the great void in between, the great chasm. Ursula dwelt on travel, Birkin on the end goal of isolation.

I can't really say who I agree with, but most of the time I find myself thinking like Ursula but feeling Birkin's deep abstraction. And from one season to the next this abstract voyage occurs again and again, ad infinitum. So it is this year, so it was the year before. January hit like a truck, May a call to arms, and now September has come and gone, and somehow I remember it like a dandelion that has bloomed a year and withered in a season, its seeds drifting somewhere, presumably to find root in a snug lot of fertile ground to produce a new generation of dandelions.

But presumably, presumably. There is no guarantee of fertility. Should I land in the icy, lonely world that Ursula and Birkin did, I think I would have gone mad. All isolated from the world. Well, Ursula and Birkin left soon enough in any case; Gudrun and Gerald did not. Gudrun was too busy admiring the sights to comfort little-boy Gerald, and Gerald was too busy being jealous of Gudrun's new 'friend' to suppress his somewhat animalistic rage. And so Gudrun ended up half-strangled and Gerald dead, frozen to death in the Alpine snow. Nature is indeed an ideal metaphor for human struggles.

If that is nature at its cruelest, then April must be nature's fairest - if we neglect sentimental nuances that certain poets have evoked. The loveliness of April seems to hold through the west and the east. A Chinese novel is touchingly entitled _You Are the April of This World_, and a British novel bears the rather romantic title _The Enchanted April_. It is presumably (again presumably) about women who are rejuvenated in their personal and romantic endeavors in that merry month by taking a trip to Italy. I have not had the opportunity to read it, though I have heard that it is a little similar to E M Forsters _Room with a View_, and I like the latter well enough that I have put off reading the former. But if England is really rain and Italy a sunny paradise, then was it Italy or April that had the power of transforming lives?

If a time and place really has that happy power, then in George Eliot's panoramic _Middlemarch_, Dorothea need not have wept in sunny Rome. And yet all the astonishing "ruins and basilicas, palaces and colossi", all these touching pillars of ancient and modern thinking, served only to bewilder her, lost in a world where her husband would rather consult galleries rather than his new bride. Alas, art and sunny Rome can only repel Dorothea, repel her for the incongruence of immortal art and the "sordid present".

This push and pull, this attraction and repulsion, seems to play out again and again in books as in our lives. But when I find I am neither the full-blooded artist with the cruel streak of flightiness or the sensitive young bride, and most certainly not the mature married women so comfortable in polite society that the only thing to do next was to dash it all to pieces, I find I have nothing to go off of, no point of reference, no mode of behavior. My seasons are short in their cruel swiftness and long in their themeless wander, but I feel them no less keenly.

I am fond of thinking and afraid of feeling, like Birkin. But neither do the seasons become metaphors for me, for I still live in the present and look at the future with wide and starry eyes, like Ursula. I am frozen in December and exultant at April, but I repel nothing; I reject nothing. When things become too fixed and static I am lost in an insoluble dreariness. I long for a close human spirit. I am cynical. I am large. The seasons mark time better than any clock. Last month, this September, I got to blow a dandelion, and I saw the wind carry its seeds away.
